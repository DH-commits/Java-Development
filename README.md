"# Java-Development" 

pkmn : A java project utilising a simple implementation of OO design principles.
Encapsulation, Abstration, Classes, Methods, Objects.
Also includes uses of data structures such as HashMaps and Arrays.
Aswell as the Manipulation of Data structures.
I like to recreate this project when learning a new language.
To run, Simply run the Main.main() method.
